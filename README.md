# BLOBLocker

BLOBLocker is a ASP.NET MVC web application to chat and upload files, completely JavaScript optional!

It was built using the EntityFramework and the Razer view engine. 

I used this project to testet out the C# crypto lib, asp.net MVC framework and the EntityFramework.

It is a long time ago since my last commit and I thought I would upload it from my private server to github.
